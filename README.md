# **Mr. Wordler**

*A solo twist on the fast‑paced word‑tile fun inspired by **Bananagrams**!*

##  **What Is Mr. Wordler?**

**Mr. Wordler** is a single‑player, drag‑and‑drop word‑building game designed to recreate the satisfying, fast‑paced feel of classic tile games — but made for one player. Your mission:

> **Use all the given letters to build a connected grid of valid words.**

If you enjoy puzzles, vocabulary challenges, or the feeling of rearranging tiles until everything *clicks*, this game is for you.

##  **How to Play**

### **1. Receive Your Letter Tiles**

Start each game with a randomized set of letters.

### **2. Drag & Drop Tiles Onto the Grid**

Use your mouse to drag tiles around the board and place them exactly where you want.

### **3. Build Valid Words**

Form horizontal or vertical words — crossword‑style.

### **4. Create a Connected Grid**

All words must link together. No isolated words allowed.

### **5. Use Every Letter**

You win when:

*  Every tile is used
*  All words are valid
*  All words connect into one structure

### **6. Rearrange Freely**

Not working? No problem — drag things around until it does.

I’ve always loved **Bananagrams**, word puzzles, and anything that challenges language skills. I created Mr. Wordler because:

* I enjoy fast, tactile word‑building games
* I wanted a **solo version** I could play anytime
* Word games genuinely help with:

  * **Improving spelling**
  * **Learning new definitions**
  * **Pattern recognition**
  * **Vocabulary expansion**

Mr. Wordler isn’t just a game, it’s a fun, brain‑stimulating word workout.
